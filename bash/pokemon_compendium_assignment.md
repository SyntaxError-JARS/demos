# Pokemon Compendium

## Requirements

-   First, uncompress all the generation csv files from the #resources channel on slack. Make sure to put this in your own working directory that is clearly identifiable.
    -   (Hint: remember to look at the tar command documentation or tar --help)
-   Next, once all this information is uncompressed using your terminal to iterate over the files and add that information into one massive pokemon_compendium.csv.
    -   (Hint: Remember for loops in bash and DON'T forget about the Header)
-   After all generations have been added to the pokemon_compendium.csv file, we want to be able to display certain fields(columns) in the file that we are interested in. Leverage a command to specifically grab each field that we are interested in. I want 10 fields in total with at least the follow: Name, Type1, hp...the remaining 7 are fields you fiew as important.
    -   (Hint: look for what an index is for arrays. also maybe look into awk)
-   Finally, see if you can format the output into a more human readable syntax when filtering out the information we want.
    -   (Hint: replace the commas with something more easily dicernable)

## When we reconviene

-   I will ask individauls from groups randomly what I need to do to complete the above requirements.
